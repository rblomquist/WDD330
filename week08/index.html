    <h3>Week 04</h3>
    <p>Activities - Read the assigned readings and followed along with some of the code from the reading. I also watched a few videos the get a better grasp on transitions and animations <br>
        I feel the team assignment went well for me. 
    <ul>
        <li><a href="activity/shapes.html">Canvas/SVG</a></li>
        <br>
        <li><a href="teamActivity/index.html">Team Activity</a></li>
    </ul>
   
    <p>Question:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Is there a time to really use canvas or svg? Even though canvas does hae some pixel manipulation with it would it be better to do it that way or just use something like photoshop with an img tag?
        </li>
    </ul>
