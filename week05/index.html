    <h3>Week 04</h3>
    <p>Activities - Read the assigned readings and continued to update my reference page of commands used. <br>
        I started working on toDo assignment and feel like I have made some good progress on it. I feel I am on track to 
        complete the activity by the due date.
    <ul>
        <li><a href="activity/index.html">Reading Activity</a></li>

    <p>Question:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Is "touchend" event listener supposed to work on mouse clicks as well?
            every time I do one it works when I switch my view to an iPhone, but when 
            I go back to responsive and use my mouse it has not been working.
        </li>
    </ul>
